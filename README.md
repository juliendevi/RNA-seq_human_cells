# RNA-seq human cells culture

Here we analysed the transcriptome of cultured human cells with and without treatment, and when adding IKMO or dexa to the treatment. 

Quality control and alignement to the reference genomes have been done by using the Snakemake file ('01_QC_and_alignment'). 

Kallisto output are then open and analysed using the 'RNAseq_human.R' script on RStudio.
